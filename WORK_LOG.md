| Aug 26 |  5-6:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                         I solved the first puzzle and finished the code for solving it. I did the same with the second and third puzzles I collaborated with Deven Dharni and got help from Anil Dharni with a bug on the Riddler Tester file. Deven and I also used google to figure out how to convert binary into a number using Java methods |
| Aug 30 | 5:30 - 6:28 | I worked with Deven (For almost the whole time) and Surya (just towards the end). We knew that we had to convert the dingbat into hexadecimal, so we googled how to do that. We saw that you had to use codePointAt to find this number. We then realized that there was a Caesar shift, and since we knew that one of the numbers should go down to 32 (space), we tested all of the sequences until we figured out that the truck was supposed to be 32. We then implemented the Caesar shift. |
